<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>After earning my Bachelor of Commerce in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, 
  I stumbled upon a surprising new passion: web development and coding. 
  It's funny how life takes unexpected turns! Coding quickly went from being just a post-graduation curiosity to something I find genuinely enjoyable and fulfilling. 
  There's a thrill in unraveling the mysteries of programming and crafting websites from scratch. Now, as I contemplate a career shift towards web development, 
  I feel excited about the prospect of diving deeper into this dynamic field, learning new skills, and contributing to innovative digital projects..</p>

<p>Reflecting on my journey, I realize that my background in logistics has equipped me with problem-solving skills and attention to detail, 
  which are invaluable in coding. Whether it's optimizing supply chains or debugging code, the essence remains the same: identifying issues, devising solutions, 
  and implementing them effectively. Moreover, the transition from a structured business environment to the creative realm of coding has been refreshing and liberating. 
  It's like unlocking a whole new world of possibilities where imagination and innovation reign supreme.</p>

<p>As I embark on this new chapter, I'm grateful for the diverse experiences that have shaped my path. While logistics taught me the importance of efficiency and organization, 
  coding has opened my eyes to the limitless potential of technology to transform industries and improve lives. With each line of code I write, I feel a sense of empowerment, 
  knowing that I have the tools to bring my ideas to life and make a tangible impact in the digital landscape.</p>

<p>In the bustling world of web development, there's always something new to learn and explore. From mastering programming languages to staying updated on the latest design trends, 
  the journey ahead is bound to be challenging yet immensely rewarding. And that's what excites me the mostâ€”the opportunity to grow, evolve, and carve out a fulfilling career 
  doing something I love.</p>
